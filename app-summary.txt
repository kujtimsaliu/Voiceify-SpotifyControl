Voiceify: Voice-Controlled Spotify App

Voiceify is a cutting-edge voice-controlled application designed to enhance the 
Spotify music listening experience. Leveraging the power of natural language processing 
and the Spotify Web API, Voiceify allows users to control their Spotify playback and access music-related information using voice commands. 
It offers an intuitive and hands-free approach to interact with Spotify's extensive music library.

Technologies Used:
Python: The core programming language used for app development.
Spotipy: A Python library for interacting with the Spotify Web API.
SpeechRecognition: A Python library for voice recognition.
dotenv: Used for managing environment variables.
Spotify Web API: Enables access to Spotify's music catalog and user playback control.
OAuth 2.0: Used for secure authentication with the Spotify API.

Key Features:
Playback Control: Play, pause, skip to the next or previous track with voice commands.
Voice Search: Search for songs, artists, albums, or playlists using natural language.
Volume Adjustment: Control music volume through voice commands for a seamless listening experience.
Music Discovery: Explore new music, view track details, and discover personalized recommendations.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive voice-driven interface that enhances accessibility.

Benefits:
Hands-Free Control: The application provides a hands-free and convenient way for users to manage their music, especially when their hands are occupied or when they are not near their device.
Enhanced User Experience: By incorporating voice recognition, the application enhances the user experience by making music playback more accessible and intuitive.

Future Enhancements:
Expanding platform compatibility (e.g., mobile devices, smart speakers).
Advanced playlist management features.
Multi-language support for a broader user base.
Integration with additional music streaming services.
